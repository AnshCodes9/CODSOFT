# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species — **setosa**, **versicolor**, and **virginica** — based on the sepal and petal measurements. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a classification model that accurately predicts the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.

This project uses the popular **Iris dataset**, which is a simple yet powerful dataset commonly used for learning classification techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the Iris dataset.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature visualization, and model building.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for training and evaluating models.
- **`models/`**: Pre-trained models and results.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset includes the following features:
- **`Sepal Length`**: The length of the sepal (in cm).
- **`Sepal Width`**: The width of the sepal (in cm).
- **`Petal Length`**: The length of the petal (in cm).
- **`Petal Width`**: The width of the petal (in cm).
- **`Species`**: The species of the flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

There are 150 samples in total, with 50 samples for each species.

## Key Features of the Project

### 1. **Data Exploration**
   - Visualizing the distribution of sepal and petal measurements.
   - Understanding the relationships between the features using scatter plots and pair plots.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing data (if any).
   - Feature scaling to ensure uniformity in the measurements.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### 3. **Modeling**
   - Implementing various classification algorithms, such as:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forest**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like:
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 4. **Evaluation**
   - Cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
   - Comparing the performance of different classifiers to choose the best one for the task.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, visualize patterns, and understand the relationships between different features.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   Train the classification models and evaluate their performance using the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory. For example:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Prediction:**
   Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the species of new iris flowers:
   ```python
   from models.predict import predict_species
   predict_species(flower_measurements)
   ```

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of `X.XX%` on the test set. The analysis showed that features such as **petal length** and **petal width** are highly significant in distinguishing between the three species.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing more advanced classification algorithms such as **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** to improve accuracy.
- Expanding the project to include more feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
- Creating a web-based interface or API for classifying new iris flower samples.
